# PipeworkMC Server
`pipeworkmc-server` is an event-driven Minecraft server library built on [Bevy ECS](https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `pipeworkmc-server` is *not* the central PipeworkMC server.
> It is a library meant for creating Minecraft servers without the need to manually handle packet en/decoding, login flow, etc.

---

If you are interested in writing your own Minecraft server *"from scratch\*"* and wish to use `pipeworkmc-server` as a base,
 start by looking at the [examples](https://github.com/PipeworkMC/pipeworkmc-server/tree/main/examples).
> [!WARNING]
> Please note that `pipeworkmc-server` is still in its very early stages and is not feature complete.
